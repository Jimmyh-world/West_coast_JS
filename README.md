## Development Philosophy

### DRY Principles Implementation

```javascript
// Centralized API client
export const apiClient = {
  async fetchData(endpoint) {
    const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/${endpoint}`);
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    return response.json();
  },
  // ... other reusable methods
};
```

### KISS Methodology Example

```javascript
// Simple, focused component structure
export function createCourseElement(course) {
  return `
    <article class="course-card">
      <h3>${course.title}</h3>
      <p>${course.description}</p>
      // ... minimal, clear markup
    </article>
  `;
}
```

### Clean Code Practices

```javascript
// Meaningful naming and clear structure
export class CourseManager {
  async fetchCourseDetails(courseId) {
    // Clear purpose and single responsibility
  }

  renderCourseList(courses) {
    // Separate rendering logic
  }
}
```
